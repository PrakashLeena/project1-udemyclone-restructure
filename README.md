# project1-udemyclone-restructure
This is a responsive clone of the Udemy homepage, built entirely using HTML5 and CSS3.
The goal of this project was to improve my frontend development skills, particularly in layout design, responsive UI, and modern CSS techniques.
 Add some animation and restructure my project
